            <h1>Combat In The Nether</h1>
            <b><p>The Nether is a hellish dimension which you can access by creating a nether portal in the
                Overworld.
                It's worth the trip, because you can find many useful items here that aren't available anywhere
                else.</p></b>
            You'll need a minimum of 10 blocks of obsidian to build a Nether Portal. Once you've constructed the
            portal, use a flint and steel
            or a fire charge to activate it, and jump through.

            <h2>Nether Portal</h2>
            A full Nether Portal can be crafted from 14 blocks of obsidian. If you're short on obsidian, save yourself 4
            blocks, and cut out the corners, it'll still work!

            Before entering the Nether equip yourself with the following.
            <br/>
            Enchanted Armor
            <br/>
            Enchanted Weapons
            <br/>
            Several stacks of cobblestone blocks to create safe paths and build a barrier to protect your nether portal.
            <br/>
            Flint and steel (you'll need it to relight your nether portal if it's destroyed)
            Torches
            Food

            Did you know?
            In the PC/Mac Edition, 1 block in the Nether equals 8 blocks in the Overworld, so you can use the Nether as
            a
            shortcut to travel quickly across long distances.
            As long as you can handle the danger, that is! In the Xbox 360 Edition, the Nether is limited in size, and 1
            block
            equals 3 blocks in the Overworld. The Nether doesn't currently exist for the Pocket Edition.
