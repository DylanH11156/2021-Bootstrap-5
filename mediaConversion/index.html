                <b><p>The Nether is a hellish dimension which you can access by creating a nether portal in the
                    Overworld.
                    It's worth the trip, because you can find many useful items here that aren't available anywhere
                    else.</p></b>

                You'll need a minimum of 10 blocks of obsidian to build a Nether Portal. Once you've constructed the
                portal, use a flint and steel
                or a fire charge to activate it, and jump through.

        <h2>Nether Portal</h2>
        A full Nether Portal can be crafted from 14 blocks of obsidian. If you're short on obsidian, save yourself 4 blocks,
        and cut out the corners, it'll still work!
